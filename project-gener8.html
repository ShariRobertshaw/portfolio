                    Gener8 is an app and browser that allows it's users to take control and be rewarded for sharing their data. I started doing freelance work for Gener8 right before they were featured on BBC's Dragon's Den in 2020. They received funding and have evolved from a browser extension, then a browser, and released their app in 2022. I have done work on and off during this journey, but they were my sole client between 2022-2024.

                    <p class="case-study-text">We began with in-depth competitor research to understand how users typically interact with tiered systems and what design patterns they find intuitive. Past user interviews highlighted that our audience is highly reward-driven but often confused by unclear instructions. With that in mind, I explored several design flows to communicate the tier structure more effectively. The process was highly iterative, our Product Manager requested multiple concepts, and we refined the designs over several rounds based on internal feedback and usability considerations.</p>
